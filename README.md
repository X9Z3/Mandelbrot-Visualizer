# Mandelbrot Visualizer

This project provides an interactive visualization of the Mandelbrot set, allowing you to explore complex fractal patterns in real time.

## Features

- Zoom around the Mandelbrot set interactively
- Adjustable iteration depth to reveal more fractal detail
- Real-time rendering with intuitive controls
- Screenshot and location/zoom recall feature for easy sharing
- Small colormap set recreated from Matlab
- Image resolution control

## How it works

The Mandelbrot set is generated by iterating the function:

z = zÂ² + c

where `c` is a complex parameter. Points that do not escape beyond a certain threshold after a set number of iterations are considered part of the set and are colored accordingly.

The image is actually a 3D sandbox environment with a locked camera. The pixels of the image are quad objects consisting of 4 vertices with the colors of those vertices corresponding to if a point escapes or not.
